        <p>
          a mysterious and little-known area in our world. Since ancient times,
          a person, looking up at the sparkling stars, dreamed of learning all
          the secrets of outer space, and most importantly, to visit there, to
          find out if there is life other than our planet. Gradually, the cosmos
          revealed one mystery after another, scientists learned a lot of new
          things, but by now, humanity knows only a small part of the mysteries
          of the cosmos.

            This is the Galaxy in which we live, it is a representative of a
            Spiral Galaxy. It has a well-defined core and a flat disk in which
            spiral arms are located. These arms are clusters of stars, gas and
            dust, where new stars are actively forming.

            Elliptical galaxies have an elliptical (rounded or oval) shape. They
            lack noticeable spiral arms and there is little star formation. They
            consist mainly of old stars and contain little gas and dust.
            Elliptical galaxies can be of various shapes — from almost spherical
            to highly elongated.

          It is a planetary system that includes the Sun and all the celestial

          revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits and are located at

        <h2>Black Holes</h2>
        <p>
          These are cosmic objects with such strong gravitational pull that not
          even light can escape them. They form when very massive stars reach
          the end of their life and collapse under their own gravity.

          <h3>Features of Black Holes</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Event Horizon — the boundary around a black hole beyond which
              nothing, including light, can escape. This is the "point of no
              return." Anything crossing the event horizon is absorbed by the
              black hole.
            </li>
            <li>
              Singularity — at the center of a black hole is a point of
              infinitely high density and gravity — the singularity. All known
              laws of physics break down at this point.
            </li>
            <li>
              Accretion Disks — some black holes can have disks of gas and
              matter around them, called accretion disks. Matter in these disks
              heats up to extreme temperatures and emits X-rays and other
              radiation before falling into the black hole.
